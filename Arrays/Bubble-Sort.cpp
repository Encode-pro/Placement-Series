/* BUBBLE SORT
TStarting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
The above process goes on until the last element.

The same process goes on for the remaining iterations.
After each iteration, the largest element among the unsorted elements is placed at the end.
